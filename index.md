# Project Summary

MyWonder is a platform for big data analytics and visualization, which helps users to do visualization from massive files under 10 minutes rather than hours wait. Thanks to the technology that distributes files on the cloud, users can quickly calculate their analytics and summaries from their phones.


# Wastes
Skill: Each of team member should create a few visualization examples, which is not reasonable. There should be some people who are professional in doing visualization examples finishing this part.

Waiting: If team manager wants to update contents, he needs to contact customer support team. Customer support team needs to talk to designers. Then designers have to let the backend team to update contents. This whole process is time-consuming.

Defect: There is no separate testing and production environments, which will cause many problems in future.
